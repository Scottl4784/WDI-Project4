# WDI16-Project4

## Overview 

With so many craft beers out there now, it is hard to keep track of all the ones you have tried! Beer Garden is a site that allows users to create an account and keep up with the beers they have tried and the ones they really enjoyed! My main goals for this project was to incorporate the new technologies we have learned as well as branch out from my comfort zone and use a styling library coupled with CSS to make the site a little more interactive. 

   ## Technologies Used

  *  Languages - HTML5, Javascript, Ruby
  *  Backend - Postgres, Rails, React, and Node 
  *  Styling - Semantic-UI and CSS
  *  Planning - Trello and Figma
  *  Hosting - Heroku
